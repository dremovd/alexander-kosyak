# Alexander Kosyak

Static website showcasing the biography and work of artist Alexander Kosyak. The site is built with plain HTML5 and modern CSS.

## Language support

English text is the default. A selector in the top-right corner lets visitors switch to Russian, German or French, each with manually curated text.

## View locally

Open `index.html` in a browser; no build step is required.

## Deploy with GitHub Pages

A GitHub Actions workflow is included to publish the site to GitHub Pages whenever changes are pushed to `main`. Enable GitHub Pages in the repository settings and select **GitHub Actions** as the source to receive a live deployment URL.
