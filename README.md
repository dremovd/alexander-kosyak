# Alexander Kosyak Portfolio

A minimalist personal portfolio site built without WIX. It showcases design sensibility through clean typography, responsive layout, and subtle interactions. The site is fully static and relies only on HTML, CSS, and a touch of vanilla JavaScript.

## Development

Open `index.html` in a modern browser to view the site. No build step is required.
