# Alexander Kosyak

Static website showcasing the biography and work of artist Alexander Kosyak. The site is built with plain HTML5 and modern CSS.

The project contains four simple pages:

- **index.html** – a splash page with four images.
- **biography.html** – full CV with sections for biography, exhibitions & residencies, awards, collections, teaching position and creative trips. Content available in English, French, German and Russian.
- **last-works.html** – placeholders for recent works.
- **contact.html** – email and phone information.

## Language support

English text is the default. A selector lets visitors switch to Russian, German or French; each language block is manually curated. Only the biography page is translated; other pages are in English.

## View locally

Open any of the HTML files in a browser; no build step is required.

## Deploy with GitHub Pages

A GitHub Actions workflow is included to publish the site to GitHub Pages whenever changes are pushed to `main`. Enable GitHub Pages in the repository settings and select **GitHub Actions** as the source to receive a live deployment URL.
