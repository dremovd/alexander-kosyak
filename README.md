# Alexander Kosyak Portfolio

A redesigned static portfolio preserving information from the original site. It presents bilingual content (English and Russian) for the Art Paris Project, biography, and contact details. The site is fully static and relies only on HTML, CSS, and a touch of vanilla JavaScript for smooth scrolling, language switching, and dynamic footer year.

## Development

Open `index.html` in a modern browser to view the site. No build step is required.
